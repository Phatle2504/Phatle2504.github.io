      <li>Personal background: I was born in Vietnam, moved to Charlotte in October 2012 when I was 18.
          My first major was Accounting but I failed the statistics class twice. That makes it impossible for me to continue my studies in this field.
          In 2016, I decided to leave school for 2 years to work to earn money to get married. Then I went back to school and chose to study information technology.
          2020, I have successfully transferred to UNCC and I am satisfied with my current major.</li>
      <li>Professional: My 1st job was in a Tofu shop working with a Tofu making machine. 
          After that, I switched to being a waiter at a restaurant and worked there part-time until now. 
          Contact with customers has greatly improved my communication because English is a problem for me.</li>
