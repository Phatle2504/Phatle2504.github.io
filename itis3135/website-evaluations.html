          <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">arngren.net</a> (a shopping website)</h3>
          <p>A sample of bad Website</p>
          <ul>
             <li>No layout for phone version.</li><br>
             <li>No company or website logo.</li><br>
             <li>They used many different font colors for the text made users harder to read. </li><br>
             <li>Most of them were bright color on the mix of green, white, yellow and purple background.</li><br>
             <li>Bad alignment.</li><br>
             <li>There are too many unevenly distributed sections with different layout for each. Some just had picture, 
               some had the text on the right of the picture, some had the text is overlaping the picture,.... </li><br>
            <li>Images was not organized well.</li><br>
             <li>Information provided was too messy. </li><br>
             <li>Proximity was very bad. </li><br>
             <li>Products are arranged in a very messy way, the bicycle is next to the binoculars,... 
               They just toss the product on the page with no calagories.</li>

                <h4>Improvement</h4>
                <li>Contrast:

                <ol>Change the background color to something very bright such as bright pink or purple</ol>
              </li><br>
              <li>Repetition: 
                <ol>Create calagories for the products. For example, create calagory for bycicle and put everything
                   related to it inside.</ol></li><br>
                   <li>
                     Alignment:
                     <ol>Inside the calagory, put the picture on the left and text on the right next to it.</ol>
                   </li><br>
                   <li>

          <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
          <h3><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov">whitehouse.gov</a>  (news website from White House)</h3>
          <p>A sample of good Website.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>They have layout for phone version.</li><br>
          <li>The White House logo is in the center on the top of the page. </li><br>
          <li>They used only 3 font simple colors for the text: dark blue, black and white made users very easy to read. </li><br>
          <li>The colors are used sensibly, dark blue and black are used on a white background. White is used on a blue or dark background. </li><br>
          <li>The content of this website is laid out very neat and clear.</li><br>
          <li>Repetition is used very well by them, the news section is very evenly spaced. </li><br>
          <li>Exelent alignment</li><br>
          <li>All titles have the same color and typeface, and so do the timestamps and authors. </li><br>
          <li> When they put the image on the left and the text on the right, the latter part they arranged in reverse.</li><br>
          <li>Proximity was very good. Pictures and texts were related to each other. 
            For example in the administration section, you see picture of Mr. President and Mrs. Vice President.</li>
            <h4>Rating (out of 5)</h4>
            <li>Contrast: 5</li>
            <li>Repetition: 4</li>
